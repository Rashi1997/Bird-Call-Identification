# Bird-Call-Identification

A database of the bird calls was used for this. [Xeno Canto Database](https://www.xeno-canto.org)
The Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) of these calls were used as features for classification of the birds using the K-Means Algorithm.
This project can be a significant help for estimating bird populations by using recorded bird calls of a certain area.
